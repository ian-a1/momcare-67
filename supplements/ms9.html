                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li><strong>Doctor's Approval First:</strong> Always consult your OB-GYNE before starting, stopping, or changing any medication.</li>
                    <li><strong>FDA Oversight:</strong> Prescription and over-the-counter medicines are reviewed and regulated by the FDA. Always rely on your doctor's guidance before use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dosage Control:</strong> Take medicines exactly as prescribed. Overuse can harm you or your baby.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing Matters:</strong> Certain drugs are safer in later trimesters. Follow your doctor's timing advice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drug Interactions:</strong> Tell your provider about everything you are taking (including herbal remedies).</li>
                    <li><strong>Symptom Monitoring:</strong> If symptoms persist, don't self-increase the dose—return to your healthcare provider.</li>
