                    Cooking Instructions
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Combine 4 cups of water and 4 cups of beef broth in a large cooking pot. Bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the halved onion, star anise (if using), and chopped celery stalks to the boiling liquid. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover the pot and continue to boil for 20 minutes. These aromatics will infuse the broth with deep flavor.</li>
                    <li>Remove the onion, star anise, and celery from the boiling liquid using a skimmer or strainer. You can discard these aromatics as they've already flavored the broth.</li>
                    <li>Add the cubed beef to the pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the beef becomes tender and easy to pierce with a fork. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface during cooking. Add more water if necessary to keep the beef submerged.</li>
                    <li>Once the beef is tender, add the quartered potatoes and halved saba bananas to the pot. Cook for 10 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender and the bananas are soft.</li>
                    <li>Add the quartered cabbage and baby bok choy to the pot. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Stir gently to combine all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pot and turn off the heat. Let the pot stay covered for 2 to 5 minutes to allow the residual heat to cook the leafy vegetables while keeping them vibrant green and crisp-tender.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a large serving bowl. Serve hot with steamed rice and a side of fish sauce with calamansi for dipping. This complete, nourishing meal is perfect for breastfeeding mothers. Share and enjoy!</li>
