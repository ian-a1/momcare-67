                    <li>Start with small portions to test tolerance, especially if you're breastfeeding</li>
                    <li>Adjust spice level (red chilies) based on your tolerance and baby's reaction through breast milk</li>

                    Cooking Instructions
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Combine 6 cups of coconut milk, thinly sliced pork, 1/2 cup shrimp paste, sliced ginger, sliced onion, and crushed garlic in a large cooking pot. Heat the pot over medium-high heat and let the mixture come to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Once the mixture starts to boil, gently stir to mix all the ingredients thoroughly. Cover the pot with a lid and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the pork becomes tender. Stir occasionally to prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                    <li>Add 3.5 oz of dried taro leaves to the pot. Important: Do not stir immediately. Let the leaves sit on top and slowly absorb the coconut milk. This takes about 20 to 30 minutes. You can gently push the leaves down into the liquid so they can absorb more coconut milk, but avoid stirring vigorously.</li>
                    <li>Once the taro leaves have absorbed most of the coconut milk and become soft, gently stir the leaves to mix them with the other ingredients. Continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Pour 2 cups of coconut cream into the cooking pot. Add 5 to 7 pieces of red chilies (adjust based on your spice tolerance). Stir gently to combine. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and becomes creamy.</li>
                    <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. The shrimp paste already provides saltiness, so add additional salt only if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve hot with steamed rice as a flavorful side dish. Share and enjoy this nutritious Bicolano delicacy!</li>
