                    Cooking Instructions
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Combine 4 cups of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of rinsed glutinous rice in a cooking pot. Turn on the heat to medium-high and let the coconut milk come to a boil. Stir gently to prevent the rice from settling at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Once the coconut milk is boiling, reduce heat to low. Stir the mixture continuously to prevent the glutinous rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Continue cooking while stirring occasionally. This will take approximately 12 to 15 minutes until the rice becomes soft and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 cup of whole kernel corn to the pot. Stir well to combine. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the corn is heated through and tender.</li>
                    <li>Add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar to the mixture. Stir thoroughly to dissolve the sugar completely and distribute it evenly. Add a pinch of salt if desired to balance the sweetness. Cook for 2 more minutes while stirring.</li>
                    <li>Taste and adjust sweetness if needed. The mixture should have a thick, creamy consistency.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to serving bowls. Can be served warm or chilled. This makes a perfect afternoon snack or dessert. Share and enjoy!</li>
