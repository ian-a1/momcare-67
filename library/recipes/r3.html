                    Cooking Instructions
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Pour 24 ounces of water in a pan and bring to a boil. Add 1½ cups of soaked mung beans to the boiling water. Let simmer until the mung beans become completely soft and tender, about 35-50 minutes. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed. Set aside when done.</li>
                    <li>In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium heat. Sauté the minced garlic, chopped onion, and chopped tomato together. Cook until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the thinly sliced pork to the pan with the sautéed aromatics. Cook all ingredients together for 5 minutes until the pork is browned on all sides and partially cooked.</li>
                    <li>Add the beef cube and 2 tablespoons of fish sauce to the pan. Stir well to dissolve the beef cube completely. Let simmer for 10 minutes or until the meat becomes tender. Add more water if needed to ensure the meat cooks properly, and simmer longer if necessary for tougher cuts.</li>
                    <li>Add 5-8 pieces of medium-sized shrimp to the pan (if using). Stir all ingredients together and cook for 2 minutes until the shrimp turn pink and are fully cooked.</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked mung beans from Step 1 to the pan with all the other ingredients. Stir everything together thoroughly and let simmer for 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld together.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 cups of spinach and ½ cup of crushed pork rind or chicharon. Season with ¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Stir gently to combine all ingredients. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the spinach wilts.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to serving bowls and serve hot with steamed rice. Share and enjoy this traditional Filipino comfort food!</li>
