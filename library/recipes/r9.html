                    Cooking Instructions
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Bring a large pot with 6-8 cups of water to a rolling boil. Gently add 1 lb of whole chicken (skin removed) and reduce heat to low-medium. Simmer for 45 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and tender (internal temperature of 165°F). Remove chicken from the pot and set aside to cool. Reserve the chicken broth for later use.</li>
                    <li>When the chicken is cool enough to handle safely, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces using your hands or two forks. Discard the bones and any remaining skin. Set aside the shredded chicken.</li>
                    <li>In a clean large pot, melt 3 tablespoons of butter with 1 tablespoon of cooking oil over medium heat. Add the minced onion, diced carrot, and minced celery. Sauté for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables become tender and aromatic.</li>
                    <li>Add the shredded chicken (and chopped ham if using) to the pot. Stir well and cook for 2 minutes to allow the flavors to merge together.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the reserved chicken broth and 2-3 cups of additional water to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and let it simmer for 20 minutes. This allows all the flavors to develop and combine beautifully.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/2 lb of elbow macaroni to the pot. Stir gently and cook for 15 minutes until the pasta is tender but not mushy. If the soup becomes too thick, add more water as needed to reach your desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Stir in 1½ cups of fresh milk or evaporated milk. Add the chopped cabbage if using. Bring to a gentle boil (do not let it boil vigorously as milk can curdle). Season with salt and pepper to taste, being careful not to oversalt.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat once the soup reaches a creamy consistency. Serve hot in bowls with crackers or bread on the side. This comforting soup is perfect for recovery and nourishment. Share and enjoy!</li>
