                    Cooking Instructions
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li>Boil 8 to 10 cups of water in a large cooking pot over high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the beef shank and marrow bones to the boiling water. Cover the pot with a lid and reduce heat to low-medium. Continue to boil gently for 1 hour. The slow boil will help tenderize the meat and begin extracting nutrients from the bones.</li>
                    <li>After 1 hour, carefully scoop away and discard the floating scums, foam, and excess oil from the surface of the water using a ladle or spoon. This creates a clearer, cleaner broth. Add the sliced onions, whole peppercorn, rock salt, and fish sauce to the pot. Cover and continue to boil on low heat for 3 more hours, checking occasionally and adding more water if needed to keep ingredients submerged.</li>
                    <li>After the total 4 hours of cooking, the beef should be tender and falling off the bone, and the broth should be rich and flavorful. If using corn, add it during the last 15 minutes of cooking.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the vegetables: Arrange the quartered cabbage and baby bok choy leaves in a large serving bowl.</li>
                    <li>Place the tender beef shanks and marrow bones over the arranged vegetables in the serving bowl. Ladle the hot, rich soup over the meat and vegetables, allowing the heat to wilt the fresh greens slightly.</li>
                    <li>Prepare a dipping sauce by combining fish sauce, sliced chili peppers, and freshly squeezed calamansi or lemon juice in a small bowl.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and the dipping sauce on the side. The bone marrow can be scooped out and enjoyed with the soup. Share and enjoy this nourishing postpartum meal!</li>
