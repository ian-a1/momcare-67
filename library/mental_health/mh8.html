                    Practical activities and conversation starters to strengthen your relationship with your partner before baby arrives. Pregnancy can strain relationships due to stress, changing roles, reduced intimacy, and differing emotional experiences. However, couples who intentionally nurture their connection during pregnancy report higher satisfaction after baby arrives and better co-parenting relationships. These exercises help you stay emotionally connected and build a strong foundation for parenthood together.

                    Deep Conversation Starters
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li><strong>"What are your biggest fears about becoming a parent?"</strong> Share without judgment. Common fears: losing identity, financial pressure, not being good enough, relationship changing. Knowing each other's fears creates empathy.</li>
                    <li><strong>"What does a 'good parent' look like to you?"</strong> Discuss your own upbringing - what you want to repeat and what you want to do differently. This reveals deep values and helps align parenting approaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>"How can I support you during labor and postpartum?"</strong> Be specific: "I need you to advocate for me with doctors" or "I need you to handle night diaper changes so I can focus on feeding." Clear expectations prevent resentment.</li>
                    <li><strong>"How will we divide baby care responsibilities?"</strong> Discuss who does night feedings, diaper changes, doctor appointments, bath time. Don't assume - make it explicit. Revisit this plan after baby arrives and adjust as needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>"What are we most excited about as parents?"</strong> End heavy conversations with positivity! Share your joys: teaching baby to swim, holiday traditions, watching them discover the world. Dream together.</li>
                    <li><strong>"How do we want to stay connected after baby?"</strong> Plan specific ways: weekly date nights (even at home after baby sleeps), daily check-ins, monthly couple getaways. Prioritizing your relationship models healthy love for your child.</li>
                    <li><strong>"What do you need from me right now?"</strong> Ask this weekly. Needs change throughout pregnancy. Maybe they need more physical affection, more help with chores, more patience with mood swings, or just acknowledgment of their experience.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li><strong>Create a baby bucket list:</strong> Things you want to do before baby (dinner at favorite restaurant, weekend trip, finish a project)</li>
                    <li><strong>Write letters to your baby together:</strong> Each write what you want your child to know about this time</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice labor positions:</strong> Partner learns how to support you physically during contractions</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan babymoon:</strong> A relaxing trip together before baby arrives (safe travel until 36 weeks)</li>

                    <li><strong>Your experience matters too:</strong> It's okay to feel excited, scared, overwhelmed, or left out</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask how you can help:</strong> Don't guess what's needed - ask directly and follow through</li>
                    <li><strong>Educate yourself:</strong> Read pregnancy books, follow baby development apps, understand what your partner is experiencing physically</li>
                    <li><strong>Validate without fixing:</strong> When they're emotional, say "That sounds really hard" instead of trying to solve the problem</li>
                    <li><strong>Be patient with physical changes:</strong> Their body is doing incredible work. Reduced sex drive, fatigue, and mood swings are temporary</li>
                    <li><strong>Find your dad/partner community:</strong> Connect with other expectant partners who understand your experience</li>

                    <li>Learn each other's love languages and intentionally speak them (words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, physical touch, gifts)</li>
                    <li>Take photos throughout pregnancy - not just belly photos, but of you two together. You'll treasure these later</li>
                    <li>Remember: You're a team. It's you two together versus the challenges, never you versus each other</li>
