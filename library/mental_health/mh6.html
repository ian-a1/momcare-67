                    <li><strong>Blood sugar fluctuations:</strong> Inconsistent eating or low blood sugar can trigger mood changes and irritability</li>

                    Step-by-Step Management Guide
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li><strong>Recognize the Pattern:</strong> Track your moods for a week. Note what time of day mood swings occur, what triggers them (hunger, tiredness, certain people/situations), and what helps. Patterns will emerge that help you predict and prepare.</li>
                    <li><strong>Validate Your Feelings:</strong> When a mood swing hits, pause and acknowledge: "I'm feeling [emotion] right now, and that's okay. My hormones are doing a lot of work to grow my baby. This feeling will pass." Don't judge yourself for crying or feeling irritable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the HALT Method:</strong> Before reacting to strong emotions, check if you're Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. These four states amplify mood swings. Address the physical need first: eat a snack, rest, call a friend, or express your anger in a healthy way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice the 5-Minute Rule:</strong> When upset, give yourself 5 minutes to feel the emotion fully - cry, journal, pace, whatever you need. Set a timer. When it goes off, take 3 deep breaths and shift your focus to something neutral or positive. This prevents spiraling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communicate with Your Partner:</strong> Create a code word or signal for "I'm having a mood swing and need patience/space." Help them understand it's not personal. When calm, explain: "When I'm emotional, I need you to [listen/give space/offer a hug]."</li>
                    <li><strong>Move Your Body:</strong> Physical movement shifts emotional energy. Take a 10-minute walk, do pregnancy stretches, dance to a favorite song, or do gentle yoga. Movement releases endorphins that naturally improve mood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distract and Redirect:</strong> When spiraling into negative thoughts, interrupt the pattern. Watch a funny video, call a supportive friend, take a warm shower, work on a puzzle, or read something uplifting. Shift your brain to neutral territory.</li>
                    <li><strong>End-of-Day Processing:</strong> Before bed, journal or talk out your emotions from the day. This prevents them from building up. Ask yourself: "What made me upset today? Was it hormones, a real problem, or both? What do I need tomorrow to feel better?"</li>
                </ol>

                    <li><strong>Cold water on wrists:</strong> Instant nervous system reset</li>
                    <li><strong>Snack with protein + carb:</strong> Cheese & crackers, apple & peanut butter stabilizes blood sugar</li>
                    <li><strong>10 deep breaths:</strong> Counts: in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6</li>
                    <li><strong>Step outside:</strong> Fresh air and sunlight boost serotonin</li>
                    <li><strong>Hug someone:</strong> Physical touch releases oxytocin (feel-good hormone)</li>
                    <li><strong>Splash face with cold water:</strong> Activates the dive reflex, calms anxiety</li>
