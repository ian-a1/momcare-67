                    Guided Sleep Meditation Script
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li><strong>Get Into Sleep Position (2 minutes):</strong> Lie on your left side with a pillow between your knees, another supporting your belly, and one under your head. Adjust until you're as comfortable as possible. Close your eyes. This is YOUR time to rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Scan & Release Tension (3 minutes):</strong> Bring awareness to the top of your head. Notice any tension and imagine it melting away. Move to your forehead... let it soften. Your jaw... let it drop open slightly. Your shoulders... let them drop away from your ears. Continue down through your arms, belly (send love to your baby), hips, legs, all the way to your toes. Release all tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Breath Awareness (2 minutes):</strong> Notice your natural breath without changing it. Feel your belly rise and fall. With each exhale, imagine sinking deeper into the bed. Your body is heavy, supported, safe. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do. Just breathe and rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization - Safe Space (3 minutes):</strong> Imagine yourself in the most peaceful place. Maybe it's a beach with gentle waves, a cozy cabin in the woods, or a soft cloud floating in the sky. Make it vivid: What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel? You and your baby are completely safe here. This is your sanctuary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Release Worries (2 minutes):</strong> If thoughts about tomorrow, labor, or responsibilities appear, acknowledge them gently: "I see you, thought. But right now, I am sleeping. I will think about you tomorrow." Imagine placing each worry in a balloon and watching it float away into the night sky.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baby Connection (2 minutes):</strong> Place your hands gently on your belly. Send love and peace to your baby. "We are resting together now, little one. You are safe, I am safe. We are preparing for sleep." Feel the connection between you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deepening Relaxation (3 minutes):</strong> Count backwards from 10 to 1. With each number, feel yourself sinking deeper into relaxation. 10... deeper. 9... heavier. 8... more relaxed. 7... drifting. 6... peaceful. 5... safe. 4... sleepy. 3... letting go. 2... almost asleep. 1... sleeping now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Allow Sleep to Come:</strong> Continue breathing softly. Your body knows how to sleep. Your baby is sleeping peacefully inside you. There is nothing left to do. Simply drift off into restful, healing sleep. (If still awake, repeat steps 6-7 or listen to soft sleep sounds).</li>
                </ol>

                    Pro Tips
                </h2>
                <ul class="tips-list">
                    <li>Start this meditation 30 minutes before your desired sleep time as part of a bedtime routine</li>
                    <li>Avoid screens (phone, TV) for at least 30 minutes before starting - blue light disrupts sleep hormones</li>
                    <li>If you wake during the night, use the "Release Worries" and "Deepening Relaxation" steps to fall back asleep</li>
                    <li>Consider using a pregnancy-safe sleep meditation app like Expectful or Calm for guided audio</li>
                    <li>Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary: cool temperature, dark, quiet, comfortable bedding</li>
                    <li>If baby kicks wake you, try gentle rocking or changing positions rather than fully waking up</li>
