                    Step-by-Step Guide
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li><strong>Get Comfortable:</strong> Sit in a comfortable chair with your back supported, or lie on your left side with a pillow between your knees. Place one hand on your chest and one on your belly.</li>
                    <li><strong>4-7-8 Breathing Technique:</strong> Close your eyes and breathe in slowly through your nose for 4 counts. Hold your breath gently for 7 counts. Exhale completely through your mouth for 8 counts. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Belly Breathing:</strong> Focus on the hand on your belly. Breathe in deeply through your nose, allowing your belly to expand like a balloon (not your chest). Your baby is getting fresh oxygen! Exhale slowly through your mouth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat the Cycle:</strong> Continue the 4-7-8 breathing pattern for 5-10 minutes, or until you feel calmer. Your hand on your belly should rise and fall more than the hand on your chest. This ensures deep, diaphragmatic breathing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add Visualization:</strong> As you breathe, visualize breathing in calmness (imagine a soft blue light) and breathing out tension or worry (imagine gray smoke leaving your body). Picture your baby safe and peaceful inside you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gradual Return:</strong> When finished, take 3 normal breaths. Slowly open your eyes and sit quietly for a moment before standing up. Notice how your body feels more relaxed.</li>
                </ol>

                <ul class="tips-list">

                    <li>Combine with positive affirmations like "I am safe" or "My body knows how to nurture my baby"</li>
