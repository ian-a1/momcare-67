                    A comprehensive, proactive guide to preparing for your emotional well-being after birth. Just as you create a birth plan, a postpartum mental health plan sets you up for success during the challenging fourth trimester. Research shows that women who plan ahead for postpartum support have significantly lower rates of postpartum depression and anxiety. Create this plan during pregnancy (ideally third trimester) when you have mental energy, then share it with your partner, family, and healthcare providers.

                    Your Postpartum Mental Health Plan
                </h2>
                <ol class="instructions-list">
                    <li><strong>Identify Your Support Team (Write Names & Phone Numbers):</strong> Who will you call for emotional support? (Best friend, mom, sister) | Who will bring meals in first 2 weeks? | Who will help with older kids/pets? | Who will watch baby so you can nap/shower? | Backup person for each role if primary is unavailable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule Professional Check-Ins:</strong> Set up 2-week postpartum visit with OB-GYN (for depression screening) | Schedule 6-week follow-up | Find a therapist NOW who specializes in postpartum - get on waitlist before birth | Save postpartum support hotline: 1-800-PPD-MOMS | Research local postpartum support groups (hospital, community center, online).</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan for Practical Needs:</strong> Freeze 20+ meals before birth or arrange meal train | Stock easy snacks near nursing station (granola bars, nuts, fruit) | Set up diaper/wipe station on each floor of house | Prep "self-care basket" with face wipes, dry shampoo, chapstick, water bottle | Arrange cleaning help for first month (hire or family help).</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Mental Health Baseline:</strong> Complete Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale NOW (while pregnant) for baseline | Partner/family should know your normal mood so they can spot changes | Discuss with partner: "If I seem [specific behaviors], I need you to suggest I call my doctor" | Give partner permission to advocate for you if you're struggling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Your Warning Signs List:</strong> Write down what depression/anxiety might look like FOR YOU specifically: "If I can't stop crying for more than 2 hours" or "If I don't want to look at the baby" or "If I think everyone would be better off without me." Share this list with partner and close family.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan for Sleep:</strong> Decide now: Will you pump so partner can do night feedings? | Set up safe sleep space in your room for baby | Discuss sleep shift system (you sleep 9pm-2am, partner 2am-7am) | Research safe co-sleeping guidelines if considering | Accept that sleep deprivation worsens mental health - prioritize rest over housework.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set Boundaries Around Visitors:</strong> Decide visitor policy NOW: First week = no visitors? Only immediate family? 2-hour time limit? | Give partner permission to enforce boundaries: "My wife needs rest, let's reschedule" | Text template ready: "We're not up for visitors today, but would love to see you next week" | Remember: You don't owe anyone access to your baby during recovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Schedule "Me Time" in Advance:</strong> Partner commits to: Daily 30-minute break for you (shower, nap, walk) | One 2-hour block per week for extended rest | Date with yourself monthly (even just coffee shop alone) | These aren't luxuries - they're mental health maintenance.</li>
